## Getting started

### Installation

1 - Clone the repository
<code>git clone https://github.com/Gabe-MGNT/ProxyScraper.git</code>

2 - Install the requirements
<code>$ pip install -r requirements.txt </code>

3 - Modify the timeout needed to accept a proxy address inside the 
[main.py](./main.py) file.

4 - Just run the main.py file
<code>$ ./main.py </code>


## Usage

This project can be used for feeding the IP list needed to rotate IP addresses for a scraping project.

## Roadmap
- [] Scrap other proxy address types (like HTTPS)
- [] Use fewer lines of code
- [] Maybe other upgrades that I'll think of
